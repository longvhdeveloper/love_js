1 . Execution contexts :
A box, a container or a wrapper which stores variables an in which a piece of our code is evaluated and executed

Execution contexts object :
1 . Variable object
2 . Scope chain
3 . "This" Variable

=====================
1 . Creation phase
    A . Creation of the Variable Object(VO)
    B . Creation Scope chain
    C . Determine value of "This" value
2 . Execution phase
    The code of function that generated the current execution context is ran line by line

=======================
- Every Javascript object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in Javascript
- The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit
- The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it.
- When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot found, the search move on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype chain.
